# Yo! Wassup, I'm @AlphaPruned 👋

 - Recent CSE Grad from **IIT Palakkad**  
 - I usually start things on a whim — if something grabs my interest, I dive right in.  
 - I love collaborating with my mates and building stuff that’s actually fun to work on.  
 -   Always down to explore something new, hack around weird ideas, or over-engineer a side project.

If you’ve read this far… maybe hang around my repos a bit?  
Who knows — you might find something that sparks your curiosity. 😄
